```

The Recruitment System architecture follows industry best practices for web application development, implementing a clear separation of concerns across three primary layers:

1. **Client Presentation Layer**: Built with React and TypeScript, this layer handles all user interface concerns. It's responsible for rendering the application interface, managing UI state, handling user input, and communicating with the backend API. The presentation layer is differentiated for three user roles (recruiters, candidates, and administrators), each with tailored interfaces and capabilities.

2. **API & Business Logic Layer**: Implemented using Node.js and Express, this middle tier processes all business logic, enforces business rules, handles authentication and authorization, and serves as the communication bridge between the presentation layer and the data storage layer. All data validation, transformation, and business process orchestration occur here.

3. **Data Storage Layer**: Utilizing PostgreSQL as the relational database management system, this foundation layer persistently stores all application data. The database schema is designed to efficiently model the recruitment domain, with properly defined relationships between entities and constraints to ensure data integrity.

### Key Architectural Characteristics

The architecture provides several important characteristics that support the system's requirements:

- **Modularity**: The system is divided into discrete, loosely coupled components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

- **Scalability**: The separation of concerns allows different layers to scale independently as needed. The stateless nature of the API layer facilitates horizontal scaling.

- **Security**: Authentication and authorization controls are centralized in the API layer, ensuring consistent security enforcement. Sensitive data is properly isolated in the database layer with appropriate access controls.

- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between layers makes the system easier to maintain and extend over time. New features can be added with minimal impact on existing functionality.

- **Type Safety**: The use of TypeScript throughout the stack ensures type consistency from database to UI, reducing runtime errors and improving developer productivity.

### Communication Flow

1. The client sends HTTP requests to the Express server.
2. The server processes these requests through middleware, including authentication checks.
3. API controllers handle the requests and delegate to appropriate business logic services.
4. Services implement core business logic and interact with the storage interface.
5. The storage interface uses Drizzle ORM to communicate with the PostgreSQL database.
6. Responses flow back through the same layers, returning data to the client.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

Several architectural components address cross-cutting concerns that span multiple layers:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented using Passport.js with session-based authentication stored in PostgreSQL.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware captures and processes exceptions.
- **Logging**: Structured logging provides visibility into system operations across all layers.
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management for different deployment scenarios.

## 2.2 Frontend Architecture

The frontend architecture of the Recruitment System is built around React and follows a component-based approach for maximum reusability and maintainability. The architecture is organized as follows:

### Component Structure

The React components follow a hierarchical structure:

1. **Page Components**: Top-level components representing complete pages in the application, such as the dashboard, job listing, or candidate profile.

2. **Layout Components**: Structural components that define the arrangement of elements on the page, including navigation, sidebars, and content areas.

3. **Feature Components**: Functional components that implement specific features, such as job cards, application forms, or interview schedulers.

4. **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements like buttons, inputs, and modals that provide consistent styling and behavior across the application.

### State Management

The state management strategy uses a combination of approaches:

1. **Local Component State**: For UI state that is only relevant to a specific component.

2. **React Query**: For server state management, data fetching, and caching. This handles the majority of the application's data requirements, with automatic refetching, caching, and synchronization.

3. **Context API**: For sharing state across component trees, particularly for auth state and theme settings.

### Routing Framework

Routing is implemented using the Wouter library, a lightweight alternative to React Router. The routing structure includes:

1. **Route Definitions**: Mapping URL paths to specific page components.

2. **Protected Routes**: Higher-order components that check authentication and role requirements before rendering protected pages.

3. **Navigation Components**: Links and programmatic navigation handled through Wouter's hooks.

### Key Frontend Architectural Patterns

1. **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs by combining simpler, reusable components.

2. **Container/Presentation Pattern**: Separating data fetching and business logic (containers) from rendering and styling (presentation).

3. **Custom Hooks**: Extracting and reusing stateful logic across components.

4. **Render Props**: Sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function.

## 2.3 Backend Architecture

The backend architecture is built around Express.js and follows an MVC-inspired pattern with clearly defined responsibilities:

### Server Structure

1. **Entry Point**: The main server file that configures the Express application, sets up middleware, and starts the HTTP server.

2. **Middleware Configuration**: Setup for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, request parsing, and error handling.

3. **Route Registration**: Organization of API endpoints into logical groups based on resource types.

### API Layer

The API layer consists of controllers that:

1. **Handle HTTP Requests**: Process incoming requests and formulate responses.

2. **Validate Input**: Ensure data meets requirements before processing.

3. **Delegate to Services**: Forward business logic to appropriate service components.

4. **Format Responses**: Structure response data according to API contracts.

### Authentication Framework

Authentication is implemented using Passport.js:

1. **Local Strategy**: Username/password authentication for all users.

2. **Session Management**: Persistent sessions stored in PostgreSQL.

3. **Authorization Middleware**: Role-based access control middleware that protects routes based on user roles.

### Storage Interface

The storage interface provides an abstraction over database operations:

1. **CRUD Operations**: Standardized methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

2. **Query Methods**: Specialized methods for complex data retrieval needs.

3. **Transaction Support**: Maintaining data integrity through atomic operations when necessary.

## 2.4 Database Architecture

The database architecture is centered around PostgreSQL and uses Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions:

### Schema Design

1. **Entity Tables**: Core tables representing primary domain entities like users, jobs, and candidates.

2. **Relationship Tables**: Tables that manage many-to-many relationships between entities.

3. **Support Tables**: Additional tables for logging, analytics, and application management.

### Relationships

1. **One-to-Many**: Relationships like users to jobs (one recruiter creates many jobs).

2. **Many-to-Many**: Relationships like jobs to candidates (managed through application tables).

3. **One-to-One**: Relationships like users to candidate profiles (each candidate has one profile).

### Drizzle ORM Implementation

1. **Schema Definition**: Type-safe schema defined in TypeScript.

2. **Query Building**: Strongly typed query construction.

3. **Migration Management**: Schema versioning and migration through Drizzle Kit.

## 2.5 Integration Points

The system includes several integration points that connect the different architectural layers:

1. **API Client**: Frontend utilities for making consistent API calls to the backend.

2. **Authentication Flow**: Coordinated authentication between frontend and backend.

3. **Real-time Updates**: Potential WebSocket connections for immediate data updates.

4. **File Upload/Download**: Handling resume uploads and document generation.

## 2.6 Security Architecture

Security is a cross-cutting concern addressed at multiple levels:

1. **Authentication**: Secure user identity verification.

2. **Authorization**: Role-based permission enforcement.

3. **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation.

4. **Session Management**: Secure session handling with appropriate timeout and renewal policies.

5. **HTTPS**: Encrypted data transmission.

6. **Password Security**: Secure password hashing and storage.

7. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries through ORM.

## 2.7 Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture supports various environments:

1. **Development**: Local environment with hot reloading and development tools.

2. **Testing**: Isolated environment for automated testing.

3. **Production**: Optimized environment for performance and reliability.

4. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline.
